### **PRD: LLM Inference-as-a-Service**

*   **Version:** v1.0.0
*   **Date:** 2025-09-18

**1. Introduction & Vision**

*   **Vision:** To create a centralized, multi-tenant, cloud-native service that delivers fast, reliable, and cost-effective access to a variety of Large Language Models (LLMs) via a simple API.
*   **Problem Statement:** Integrating LLMs into applications is complex and expensive. Individual teams face significant challenges in managing GPU infrastructure, optimizing model performance for low latency and high throughput, and ensuring scalability and reliability. This creates a high barrier to entry and leads to duplicated effort and inefficient resource utilization.
*   **Business Goal:** Accelerate the adoption of AI within the organization by providing a robust, managed platform that abstracts away the complexity of LLM inference, allowing development teams to focus on building features.

**2. Scope**

*   **In-Scope:**
    *   A stateless API for text generation.
    *   Support for at least two different open-source LLM models (e.g., Llama 3 8B, Llama 3 70B).
    *   Server-Sent Events (SSE) for token streaming.
    *   API Key-based authentication and rate limiting.
    *   Container-based deployment on a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP).
    *   Core observability stack (metrics, logs, traces).

*   **Out-of-Scope:**
    *   Model training or fine-tuning.
    *   A graphical user interface (GUI) or playground.
    *   Complex billing and metering per user/team.
    *   Support for multi-modal models (image/audio input).
    *   Asynchronous inference with webhooks.

**3. Functional Requirements (FR)**

*   **FR1: API Endpoint for Text Generation:** The service must expose a primary `POST /v1/chat/completions` endpoint.
    *   **FR1.1: Request Payload:** The API must accept a JSON payload containing:
        *   `model`: A string identifier for the requested LLM (e.g., `"llama3-70b"`).
        *   `messages`: An array of message objects representing the conversation history.
        *   `stream`: A boolean flag to enable or disable streaming.
        *   (Optional) Generation parameters: `temperature`, `top_p`, `max_tokens`.
    *   **FR1.2: Response Payload (Non-streaming):** The API must return a JSON object with the generated text.
    *   **FR1.3: Response Payload (Streaming):** The API must use Server-Sent Events (SSE) over HTTP to stream back tokens as they are generated.

*   **FR2: Model Management API:** A secured, internal API must exist to manage the lifecycle of models.
    *   **FR2.1: Load Model:** Ability to load a new, supported model into the inference cluster.
    *   **FR2.2: Unload Model:** Ability to gracefully unload a model to free up resources.

*   **FR3: Security & Access Control:**
    *   **FR3.1: Authentication:** All API requests must be authenticated using a unique API key passed in the request header.
    *   **FR3.2: Rate Limiting:** The system must enforce per-API-key rate limits (e.g., requests per minute) to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.

**4. Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) & Service Level Objectives (SLOs)**

*   **NFR1: Performance & Latency:**
    *   **SLO 1.1 (Time-to-First-Token):** For a standard request (e.g., Llama 3 8B, 1024 input tokens), the 95th percentile (P95) TTFT must be **< 500ms**.
    *   **SLO 1.2 (Time-per-Output-Token):** For the same standard request, the P95 TPOT must be **< 50ms** (equivalent to > 20 tokens/sec).

*   **NFR2: Throughput & Utilization:**
    *   **SLO 2.1 (System Throughput):** The system must support at least **1,000 concurrent user sessions** during peak load.
    *   **SLO 2.2 (Resource Efficiency):** The architecture must achieve an average GPU utilization of **>70%** during peak business hours.

*   **NFR3: Availability & Reliability:**
    *   **SLO 3.1 (Uptime):** The API Gateway and core services must have a **99.9% uptime**.
    *   **NFR3.2 (Fault Tolerance):** The system must be resilient to the failure of any single node or component without causing service-wide outages.

*   **NFR4: Scalability:**
    *   **SLO 4.1 (Load Scaling):** The system must be able to auto-scale its inference capacity based on request volume, handling a 3x surge in traffic within 5 minutes.
    *   **SLO 4.2 (Model Scaling):** The architecture must support adding new LLM models with zero downtime for existing models.

*   **NFR5: Observability:**
    *   **NFR5.1: Metrics:** The system must export key metrics, including: request rate, error rate, latency (TTFT, TPOT), GPU utilization (compute, memory), and queue depths.
    *   **NFR5.2: Logging:** All components must produce structured logs for debugging and auditing.
    *   **NFR5.3: Tracing:** End-to-end tracing must be implemented to diagnose latency bottlenecks across the service stack.

*   **NFR6: Maintainability & Deployability:**
    *   **NFR6.1:** All infrastructure must be defined using Infrastructure as Code (e.g., Terraform).
    *   **NFR6.2:** All application and model deployments must be automated via a CI/CD pipeline.

**5. Constraints & Assumptions**

*   **C1: Technology Stack:** The system will be built on a container orchestration platform (Kubernetes).
*   **C2: Hardware:** The service will utilize modern GPUs with sufficient VRAM for the target models (e.g., NVIDIA A100/H100).
*   **C3: Optimization Techniques:** The design must incorporate KV Caching, Continuous Batching, and Tensor Parallelism as foundational optimization strategies.
*   **A1: Cloud Environment:** The system will be deployed on a major public cloud provider (AWS, GCP, or Azure), leveraging their managed Kubernetes and networking services.
